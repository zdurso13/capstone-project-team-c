# Project Title: 
Predicting Marathon Average Finishing Times: The Impact of Weather and Air Quality on Marathons

## Background: 
Research has shown weather conditions and air quality can significantly affect a runner's marathon performance.

This project explores how environmental factors—such as temperature, dew point, wind speed, precipitation, visibility, and air quality collectively impact average finishing times across different performance groups (elite, competitive, intermediate, recreational and slow runners). The goal is to determine whether these conditions can help predict how different groups of runners are affected by the environment in a given year.

Understanding these patterns can help:

- prepare security details and medical logistics along the course based on assumptions of where runners will be
- event organizers to prepare runner waves, hydration and cooling stations in the most effective ways
- runners to prepare their pacing and set their expectations as a result of given weather conditions 


## Research Question: 
Can weather and environmental factors—such as temperature, wind speed, precipitation, dew point, visibility, sea level pressure, and air quality—predict average marathon finishing times across different performance groups (elite, competitive, average, and slow runners) and genders? 

## Hypothesis & Predictions
 
**Hypothesis:** Poor weather conditions (e.g., higher temperatures, dew point wind speed, precipitation, sea level pressure, or worse air quality) are associated with slower average finishing times, particularly for non-elite runners.

**Predictions:**  Elite runners are expected to be less affected by challenging weather and air quality, competitive and slow runners will experience greater slowdowns as conditions worsen with slow runners experiencing greater slowdowns. Female runners will show slightly less performance declines under adverse weather and environmental conditions. Overall, favorable conditions—moderate temperatures, low humidity, and clean air are expected to be associated with faster finishing times for all groups.
